# Welcome to the Product Manager project!

This project is a basic example of a product listing and management system, built using the following technologies:

- React: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows you to create reusable components that can be easily rendered and updated in the browser.

- React Queries: React Queries is a library that helps you manage the data fetching and caching needs of your React components. It makes it easy to declaratively specify when and how to fetch data, and automatically updates your components with the latest data when it becomes available.

- Vite: Vite is a modern build tool for frontend development. It is based on the esbuild module bundler and is designed to be fast and lightweight. It can be used as an alternative to tools like Webpack or Parcel.

- json-server: json-server is a tool that allows you to quickly set up a fake REST API for testing and prototyping purposes. It is useful for testing the frontend of your application without having to set up a full backend server.

- Axios: Axios is a JavaScript library that allows you to make HTTP requests from the browser. It is used in this project to fetch data from the json-server API and to send create, update, and delete requests to the server.

- Tailwind: Tailwind is a CSS framework that provides a set of pre-defined styles and utilities that you can use to quickly style your application. It allows you to build custom designs without having to write your own CSS from scratch.

In this project, you will find a list of products that can be managed using basic CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations. You can add new products, view and edit existing products, and delete products that are no longer needed. The application uses json-server to store the product data and Axios to communicate with the server.

To get started with the project, you will need to install the necessary dependencies by running `npm i` in the root directory of the project. Then, you can start the json-server and the development server by running `npm run back` and `npm run dev`, respectively. This will start the application and allow you to begin using it.

Thank you for using the Product Manager project! We hope it helps you learn more about these technologies and how they can be used together to build a simple CRUD application.
